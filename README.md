# Day 1 Challenges

>> Learned the fStrings, basic calculations and some small basis in Python.
>> Encountered some minor technical things in VS Code like installing the packages, CANNOT FIND "Linter" in the format though.
>> Probably nothing to take notes yet. Need to learn more so I can see the connection between this and the PC Denoising.
